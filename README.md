# gpt-overflow
A GPT-2 model finetuned on StackOverflow data to answer technical questions.
Maybe even a frontend to serve the model kinda like chatGPT w/o rlhf with
domain specific knowledge.

The Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stackoverflow/pythonquestions

In this repo I would be using the pretrained GPT-2 weights from
huggingface instead of training the whole model myself due to lack of GPUs :(
