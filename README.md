# gpt-overflow
A GPT-2 model finetuned on StackOverflow data to answer technical questions.

The Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stackoverflow/pythonquestions

In this repo I would be using the pretrained GPT-2 weights from 
huggingface instead of training the whole model myself due to lack of GPUs 
:(
